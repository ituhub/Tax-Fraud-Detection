# Tax Fraud Detection System

This is a Streamlit application that simulates a tax fraud detection system using a synthetic dataset. The app allows users to explore the data, train a machine learning model, and predict the likelihood of fraud on new tax return data.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:**
  - View and analyze the synthetic tax return data.
  - Visualize fraud class distribution and feature distributions.

- **Model Training:**
  - Train a Random Forest Classifier to detect potential fraud.
  - Handle class imbalance using SMOTE.
  - View classification reports and confusion matrices.

- **Fraud Prediction:**
  - Input new tax return information.
  - Predict the likelihood of fraud.
  - Display prediction probabilities.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
